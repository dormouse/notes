How to Use Markdown {#howto-sphinx-markdown}
===================

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a
lightweight markup language with a simplistic plain text formatting
syntax. It exists in many syntactically different *flavors*. To support
Markdown-based documentation, Sphinx can use
[MyST-Parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
MyST-Parser is a Docutils bridge to
[markdown-it-py](https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-py), a
Python package for parsing the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)
Markdown flavor.

Configuration
-------------

To configure your Sphinx project for Markdown support, proceed as
follows:

1.  Install the Markdown parser *MyST-Parser*:

``` {.Bash}
pip install --upgrade myst-parser
```

1.  Add *myst\_parser* to the [extensions]{.title-ref} configuration
    option:

``` {.Python}
extensions = ['myst_parser']
```

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

MyST-Parser requires Sphinx 2.1 or newer.
:::

1.  If you want to use Markdown files with extensions other than `.md`,
    adjust the [source\_suffix]{.title-ref} variable. The following
    example configures Sphinx to parse all files with the extensions
    `.md` and `.txt` as Markdown:

``` {.Python}
source_suffix = {
    '.rst': 'restructuredtext',
    '.txt': 'markdown',
    '.md': 'markdown',
}
```

1.  You can further configure *MyST-Parser* to allow custom syntax that
    standard *CommonMark* doesn\'t support. Read more in the
    [MyST-Parser
    documentation](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/syntax-optional.html).

pydata-sphinx-theme
===================

Home Page: <https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme>

The theme is available on PyPI and conda-forge. You can install and use
as follows:

1.  Install the pydata-sphinx-theme in your doc build environment:

    ``` {.python}
    pip install pydata-sphinx-theme
    # or
    conda install pydata-sphinx-theme --channel conda-forge
    ```

2.  Then, in the conf.py of your sphinx docs, you update the html\_theme
    configuration option:

    ``` {.python}
    html_theme = "pydata_sphinx_theme"
    ```

sphinx-autobuild
================

Homepage: <https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-autobuild>

Rebuild Sphinx documentation on changes, with live-reload in the
browser.

Installation
------------

sphinx-autobuild is available on PyPI. It can be installed using pip:

``` {.Bash}
pip install sphinx-autobuild
```

Usage
-----

To build a classical Sphinx documentation set, run:

``` {.Bash}
sphinx-autobuild docs docs/_build/html
```

This will start a server at <http://127.0.0.1:8000> and start watching
for changes in the docs/ directory. When a change is detected in docs/,
the documentation is rebuilt and any open browser windows are reloaded
automatically. KeyboardInterrupt (ctrl+c) will stop the server.

Using with Makefile

> FYI: Sphinx is planning to move away from using Makefile.

To use sphinx-autobuild with the Makefile generated by Sphinx, add the
following to the end of the Makefile:

``` {.Bash}
live:
    sphinx-autobuild "$(SOURCEDIR)" "$(BUILDDIR)" $(SPHINXOPTS) $(O)
```

Then use command to make live documentation:

``` {.Bash}
make live
```

requirements.txt
================

``` {.Bash}
pip freeze > requirements.txt
pip install -r path\to\requirements.txt
pip install -i https://pypi.doubanio.com/simple -r path\to\requirements.txt
```

readthedocs
===========

Read the Docs supports configuring your documentation builds with a YAML
file. The configuration file must be in the root directory of your
project and be named [.readthedocs.yaml]{.title-ref}. For example:

``` {.python}
# .readthedocs.yaml
# should be put in the root of
# Read the Docs configuration file
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html for details

# Required
version: 2

# Set the version of Python and other tools you might need
build:
os: ubuntu-20.04
tools:
    python: "3.9"
    # You can also specify other tool versions:
    # nodejs: "16"
    # rust: "1.55"
    # golang: "1.17"

# Build documentation in the docs/ directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
configuration: docs/conf.py

# If using Sphinx, optionally build your docs in additional formats such as PDF
# formats:
#    - pdf

# Optionally declare the Python requirements required to build your docs
python:
install:
- requirements: docs/requirements.txt
```

Jupyter Notebook Tools for Sphinx
=================================

nbsphinx is a Sphinx extension that provides a source parser for
[\*.ipynb]{.title-ref} files. Custom Sphinx directives are used to show
Jupyter Notebook code cells (and of course their results) in both HTML
and LaTeX output. Un-evaluated notebooks -- i.e. notebooks without
stored output cells -- will be automatically executed during the Sphinx
build process.

Quick Start:

1.  Install nbsphinx

2.  Edit your conf.py and add \'nbsphinx\' to extensions:

    ``` {.python}
    extensions = [
        'nbsphinx',
    ]
    ```

3.  Edit your index.rst and add the names of your [\*.ipynb]{.title-ref}
    files to the toctree.

4.  Run Sphinx!

Online documentation (and example of use):
<https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/>

Source code repository (and issue tracker):

Issue
-----

There is a issue:No Pygments lexer found for \"ipython3\".

see: <https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/issues/528>

Why: the ipython in conda is not work.

How to fix: use [pip]{.title-ref} install ipython in venv of the
projcet.
